# üí´ About Me:
I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the American International University Bangladesh. With a foundational knowledge of programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, and SQL, I am actively expanding my skills in web development.

I have developed proficiency in HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and React, and I aspire to become a skilled developer.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy playing story-driven games, which fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills.
